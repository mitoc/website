# Leader pictures

This folder contains the pictures used on the /about/officers page.

## Guidelines

- Pictures should be square
- Keep file size under 250kB
- Use JPEG rather than PNG (it's lighter)
- 800x800 with 72 resolution is more than enough for the size displayed on the page (quite small)
