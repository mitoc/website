### 1. (Optional) Join [MITOC mailing lists](/mailing-lists)

Mailing lists are our primary way to announce upcoming events and organize informal trips. You do _not_ have to pay the membership fee to join mailing lists, and paying the fee will _not_ automatically sign you up for any mailing lists!

### 2. (Recommended) [Make an account on our trips site](https://mitoc-trips.mit.edu/accounts/signup/)

An account is necessary to participate on official trips, and it makes it easier to pay membership dues and complete waivers.

### 3. [Pay your annual membership dues](https://mitoc-trips.mit.edu/profile/membership)

It is mandatory that you join MITOC before renting gear or signing up for a trip. _Membership dues are non-refundable._

### 4. [Sign our liability waiver](https://mitoc-trips.mit.edu/profile/waiver)

If you opted not to make an account, please use the same email address that you used when paying membership dues.
