The MIT Outing Club’s “Camelot” cabin, set on 20 acres near Rumney, NH, has been a center of the club’s activities for nearly 50 years. Countless MITOCers are first introduced to outdoor recreation and camaraderie at events based out of Camelot. To maintain this opportunity for future generations of MIT students, we plan to build a new bunkhouse on the Camelot property, providing sleeping space for 50 people. The new bunkhouse will be sited a few hundred yards away from the existing cabin and will provide heated sleeping space in a modern, safe, tightly insulated building enclosure.

The bunkhouse project has been in discussion for almost a decade. Active development was kick-started in 2018 by a generous initial donation in memory of Joris Naiman. Over 2019 and 2020, the Outing Club worked with Maclay Architects to create a bunkhouse design that complies with all modern building codes, is satisfactory to MIT Facilities and the local town board, and yet maintains the wilderness ethos of the Outing Club and its Camelot property. This is no small feat in the year 2021!

With this plan in hand, the Outing Club has decided to move forward with bunkhouse construction. We plan to spend 2022 raising funds, and then construct the bunkhouse over the spring and summer of 2023. With an estimated total cost of $500,000, we need your help in raising the funds to proceed with construction. If you are able, please consider donating to ensure MITOC can fulfill its mission for the next generation of MITOCers.

On behalf of the MIT Outing Club community, we look forward to seeing you in the near future at the new MITOC Camelot bunkhouse.
