### General Guidelines for Reimbursement

*   Follow the instructions on this page carefully. If not, your reimbursement may be delayed or we will be unable to process it. If in doubt, email [mitoc-trez@mit.edu](mailto:mitoc-trez@mit.edu).
*   Most of the restrictions on what we can and cannot purchase/reimburse come from the [Student Activities Office](http://studentlife.mit.edu/sao/finance) and are non-negotiable. Make yourself aware of these by reviewing this page BEFORE purchasing MITOC items, and do not ask the treasurer to try to skirt these rules.
*   To get reimbursed, you must submit i) an itemized receipt and ii) proof of payment. Proof of payment can be a listed credit card on the receipt or as "Balance=$0", "Paid", etc. If proof of payment is not present, a statement with everything except the transaction and your name can be accepted.
*   **KEEP ALL RECEIPTS UNTIL REIMBURSED!!!** If you do not have proof of payment, you CANNOT be reimbursed. As of February 2018, physical receipts DO NOT need to be submitted for non-travel expenses.
*   For Amazon orders, you must submit the final order details, which are itemized and have proof of payment. This can be found under Your Account >> Your Orders >> Invoice AFTER the order has shipped.
*   Avoid cash.
*   All receipts should be in USD. If not, include screenshots of official conversions to USD.
*   Tip can be reimbursed with proof of payment.
*   Sales tax cannot be reimbursed; however, purchases made on MIT's behalf can be exempted from sales tax. Use the forms [here](http://vpf.mit.edu/forms/7/1220) (MIT certificates required) if vendors require proof of exemption.
*   DO NOT pay more than $1000 for computers/software, or $5000 for other items. Large purchases must be made with requisitions. Email [mitoc-trez@mit.edu](mailto:mitoc-trez@mit.edu) prior to placing large orders.
*   If you are paying a single individual (e.g. a speaker), you may need the payee to fill out a [W-9 form](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw9.pdf) ahead of time.

### To Get Reimbursed

1.  **Fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe0tR-cIxVUJy_Ci0Rsk7zajWchs-bv8XzXdvSXfi3CFKVLkA/viewform). Remember to subtract sales tax if included.**
2.  Ensure you have i) an itemized receipt and ii) proof of payment. Proof of payment, if not on the itemized receipt, can be a credit/debit card statement _with everything except your name and the transaction in question removed._
3.  If you have physical receipts, write your name on the receipt(s) and scan a digital copy. Ensure size of each image is <2 MB.
4.  Follow the specific directions below:


{% template panel.html title: "Course Subsidies" id: "courses" %}

  Email both the leader coordinator and [mitoc-trez@mit.edu](mailto:mitoc-trez@mit.edu) listing the course you will be reimbursed for. Then follow the directions on this page for "Other non-travel" that applies to you.

{% endtemplate %}

{% template panel.html title: "Travel/gas (including leader gas subsidies) - with MIT certificates" id: "travel-cert" %}

  Ensure you have access to [Concur](http://concur.mit.edu/). If travel did not involve any personal vehicle mileage:

  1.  Fill out the report using the MITOC cost object/account: 2720209. Attach copies of all receipts, but DO NOT SUBMIT YET.
  2.  Generate a _Detailed Report with Allocation Summary_ from the Print/Email dropdown and send to [mitoc-trez@mit.edu](mailto:mitoc-trez@mit.edu).
  3.  Treasurer will reply with a signed approval form, which should then be attached to Concur report and submitted.

  Personal mileage can be reimbursed using Concur, however, that reimbursement rate is determined by MIT (~$0.54/mi). Email [mitoc-trez@mit.edu](mailto:mitoc-trez@mit.edu) before requesting reimbursement for personal mileage to ensure correct rate is used.

  If you do not have access to the [Concur reporting tool](http://concur.mit.edu/), you must fill out a [travel voucher](http://studentlife.mit.edu/sites/default/files/Travel%20Voucher.pdf) and send to [mitoc-trez@mit.edu](mailto:mitoc-trez@mit.edu). Unlike other reimbursements, HARD COPIES OF RECEIPTS ARE REQUIRED!!! For personal vehicle mileage, include a Google Maps printout of the route for mileage.

  *   Go to [Atlas](http://atlas.mit.edu/) and click on “Full Catalog.” Under “My Reimbursements,” select “Request a Reimbursement for Me.”
  *   Fill out the RFP (“Request for Payment”), leaving the G/L Account and Cost Object values empty. Include a description of the expense and if it came out of a discretionary budget. For food reimbursements, include what it was for and roughly how many MIT students/affiliates/others attended. In the amount box, be sure to subtract sales tax for all items.  
      NOTE: If you have multiple receipts, you can submit them all on the same RFP. Click “Add Line” to add other items.
  *   Click Save & Continue
  *   Add a scanned image of the itemized receipt(s) and proof of payment. If the receipt does not have proof of payment, a statement with everything but the name and transaction whited out is acceptable (but not preferred).
  *   Using the button on the RFP page, send the RFP to the current treasurer (see the [list of current BOD members](/about/officers) if you aren't sure who that is)
