### Code of Conduct

All members of the club are expected to follow the policies and ideals detailed in [Hand and Mind](https://handbook.mit.edu/).

MITOC maintains a “zero-tolerance” policy (resulting in removal from the club) for the following behaviors: stalking, violent threats of any kind, physical violence (including sexual assault), domestic/dating violence, and sexual harassment. Reach out to [mitoc-mediation@mit.edu](mitoc-mediation@mit.edu) with questions/concerns.

Please note that Mediation Chairs are not a fully confidential source, and information may be shared with MITOC leadership on a need-to-know basis for the health/safety of the club. Students/MIT-affiliates are also encouraged to reach out to [MIT resources](https://idhr.mit.edu/supportive-measures/resources/students/) for support.
