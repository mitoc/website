If you are renting gear for the first time, please read the [gear rental information](/rentals) in full.

Security deposits vary by individual item. The deposit amounts below are averages.

### Restricted Gear

Items highlighted in <span style="color: red">red</span> require a safety review and permission from the appropriate MITOC officer before you can rent them. You can get approval by emailing [mitoc-approval@mit.edu](mailto:mitoc-approval@mit.edu) 24 hours ahead of time. Be sure to include exactly what restricted gear you want to check out, what dates you'll have it, how and where it will be used, and your level of experience with the activity.

### Financial aid

If you are an MIT student renting gear for a MITOC trip and this cost is prohibitive to your participation, please email [mitoc-owner@mit.edu](mailto:mitoc-owner@mit.edu) to ask about this fee being waived. If you are a non-MIT student please feel free to email to ask about financial assistance options.

**IMPORTANT:** We approve Alpine Touring and Splitboard equipment rental requests on a weekend-by-weekend basis. You can pick up skis during Thursday or Friday office hours and **MUST** return them during the next Tuesday office hours. (Longer rentals are rare and on a case-by-case basis.) Please email your requests on Sunday or Monday before you want to rent, including: (1) what ski/boot/splitboard size you want (including gear numbers if you know specific skis and boots have fit you well in the past), (2) which weekend you want to rent for, (3) a confirmation that you can return the gear by or at Tuesday office hours, (4) where and when you are going (our gear is only for backcountry skiing/riding, not resorts), and (5) your experience backcountry skiing/riding and using the gear. We will grant approvals on Tuesday or Wednesday. You will be approved for specific gear numbers and CANNOT substitute other items for any reason without explicit approval from the ski chairs (desk workers cannot grant this approval).

### Boats and Cabin Rentals

MITOC has a selection of flatwater and whitewater canoes, kayaks, and packrafts available for rental. To rent these, you must first attend a boathouse keyholder training. See the [boathouse page](/rentals/boathouse) for more information on boathouse rentals.

We own two [cabins in New Hampshire](/rentals/cabins) where MITOC members can stay. These also require keyholder training before you rent.
