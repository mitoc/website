MITOC has an active group of cross country and backcountry skiers, with trips typically running from January through May. If you are interested in learning to cross country and/or backcountry ski, we run introductory trips during [Winter School](/events/winter-school). In addition, MITOCers organise trips not only here in the Northeast but across the US and beyond. Join the [skiing mailing list](http://mailman.mit.edu/mailman/listinfo/mitoc-bcski) and become a member of our skiing community. Upcoming trips and events will be announced on this list.

You can rent cross-country, backcountry, telemark, and AT ski equipment from MITOC. Please see the [gear rental information page](/rentals) for details. MITOC does not have downhill/alpine ski equipment for rental.
