MITOC has an active group of cross country and backcountry skiers, with trips typically running from January through May. If you are interested in learning to cross country and/or backcountry ski, we run introductory trips during [Winter School](/events/winter-school). In addition, MITOCers organise trips not only here in the Northeast but across the US and beyond. Join the [skiing mailing list](http://mailman.mit.edu/mailman/listinfo/mitoc-bcski) and become a member of our skiing community. Upcoming trips and events will be announced on this list.

You can rent cross-country, backcountry, telemark, and AT ski equipment from MITOC. Please see the [gear rental information page](/rentals) for details. MITOC does not have downhill/alpine ski equipment for rental.


### IKON pass student discount (2023-24)

<img src="/images/skiing/ikon_map.jpeg" style="width: 50%; height: 50%">

MITOC is part of the [Ikon Pass](https://www.ikonpass.com/) College Ski Club program. MITOC members who are also **current students** (grad or undergrad at any college/university) can get discounted passes ($839 for the Ikon Pass, $599 for the Ikon Base Pass, and $429 for the Ikon Session 4-Day Pass), which is $300-$400 less than the [public pass prices](https://www.ikonpass.com/en/shop-passes). Staff, faculty, affiliates, etc are unfortunately not eligible.

The major distinction between the Ikon and Base passes are that the Base passes have some blackout dates, and provide 5 days vs 7 days at the non-core resorts. You usually break even on the pass in 3-5 days of skiing at Northeast Ikon resorts vs paying online or window lift ticket prices. 

In the Northeast, locations include:
- Stratton, VT (unlimited - includes spring skiing)
- Sugarbush, VT (unlimited - includes spring skiing)
- Tremblant, QC (unlimited)
- Killington-Pico, VT
- Sugarloaf, ME
- Sunday River, ME
- Loon, NH

The 23/24 Ikon Base Pass does not have access to Aspen/Snowmass, Jackson Hole, Alta, Deer Valley, Snowbasin or Sun Valley.

To benefit from the discount, please **[fill out this form](https://forms.office.com/r/8LyrqsNhkn)**. It asks for some info to help us and Ikon verify your student status. Follow the instructions, and after we validate everything we will contact you with a single-use code to use on the [Ikon Pass website](https://www.ikonpass.com/en/shop-passes). Passes must be purchased by December 1, 2023 - codes will not work after that date!

Please direct questions to [mitoc.ikon@gmail.com](mailto:mitoc.ikon@gmail.com).
