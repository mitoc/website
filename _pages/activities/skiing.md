MITOC has an active group of cross country and backcountry skiers, with trips typically running from January through May. If you are interested in learning to cross country and/or backcountry ski, we run introductory trips during [Winter School](/events/winter-school). In addition, MITOCers organise trips not only here in the Northeast but across the US and beyond. Join the [skiing mailing list](http://mailman.mit.edu/mailman/listinfo/mitoc-bcski) and become a member of our skiing community. Upcoming trips and events will be announced on this list.

### Personal trips

You can rent cross-country, backcountry, telemark, and AT ski equipment from MITOC. We encourage personal trips and rent out our fleet for personal use, except during [Winter School](/events/winter-school). Please use our gear responsibly and adhere to the club rules. **MITOC does not have downhill/alpine ski equipment for rental.**

    <img style="max-width: 50%; height: auto;" alt="Our skis are for backcountry use ONLY. Resort skiing is not allowed unless the user is uphill skiing. Do not aggressively load the equipment. MITOC has a strict no avalanche terrain policy. There can be no exceptions." src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/518dfb6c-a22b-4fe2-8b88-08b396478fd2" />
</p>

*Disclaimer: We are NOT a guiding service nor a rental service. We do not guarantee the availability of our equipment; and while we strive to keep all our gear in safe and working order, we cannot be responsible for personal rentals of our gear. We do not adjust nor fit boots and skis; these are responsibilities left to the user.*

#### How to rent equipment for personal trips

You need an active membership and need to have provided two personal checks – see [MITOC rentals](/rentals) for more information. MITOC rents alpine touring and splitboard equipment with prior approval from the backcountry ski chairs. **Cross country (nordic) skis and Telemark skis are not restricted gear and can be rented without prior approval.**

You can find the alpine touring (AT) ski and splitboard request form [here](https://forms.gle/7tcaCrP4AtGFbPrz5), or email us at mitoc-approval@mit.edu .

</p>

***IMPORTANT:*** We approve AT and splitboard equipment rental requests on a weekend-by-weekend basis. You can pick up skis during Thursday or Friday office hours and MUST return them during the next Tuesday office hours. Office hour calendar can be found [here](/calendar). (Longer rentals are rare and on a case-by-case basis.) 
Please submit the request form on Sunday or Monday before you want to rent. We will grant approvals on Tuesday or Wednesday. You will be approved for specific gear numbers and CANNOT substitute other items for any reason without explicit approval from the ski chairs (desk workers cannot grant this approval).
We will cash your check if you damage our gear!!!

#### Q) How can I adjust the alpine touring (AT) ski/splitboard bindings?

    A) Some of our kits have Dynafit ST Rotation bindings; others have frame bindings. 
    The splitboards have puck-style soft boot bindings. 
    Please watch these videos for how to adjust and use the Dynafit bindings

    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sUZrgawY5c&t=9s 
 
    For the frame bindings,

    For the splitboard,

    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7jPRcPbOJQ

    You will need to make all adjustments by yourself. You can use the in-office tools to adjust the bindings.

<div class="well" markdown="1">
   
#### Q) What fit should my alpine touring (AT) boots have? What size AT skis should I choose? 

    A) Alpine touring boots should not fit as tightly as alpine ski boots. 
    When you step into the boot and stand up, your toes should be close to the front of the boot but should NOT be touching the front. 
    When you lean forward in an athletic stance, your toes should NOT be touching the front. 
    You should also ensure your ankles are not too snug or too loose. 
    Too snug and you will get hotspots on the uphill. 
    Too loose and you will lose responsiveness of the skis on the downhills. 
    On the uphills, you can unbuckle your boots almost completely to give your feet more room and prevent hotspots.

    We recommend choosing skis that are shoulder to chin height. Choose shorter skis for easier maneuverability.

#### Q) When is the MITOC office open?

    A) Consult the [Office Hour Calendar](/calendar).
