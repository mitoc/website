MITOCers have been rock climbing since the 1940s, and put up first ascents of many classic Northeast climbs. MITOC holds numerous climbing trips throughout the year. They include:

*   [Circus](/events/circus) - Held monthly April through October.
*   [Acadia](/events/acadia) - Held annually, typically in May.

MITOC also holds numerous climbing events, clinics, and courses, such as:

*   [School of Rock](/events/school-of-rock) - MITOC's rock climbing mentor session dedicated to getting climbers outside on real rock.
*   [Self Rescue](/events/courses) - Intro course for dealing with emergencies in the vertical terrain
*   [Technical Review Sessions](/events/trs) - week-to-week review sessions to practice skills necessary for climbing
*   [Mentor/Mentee Program](/activities/rock-climbing/mentor-mentee) - building the climbing community by pairing folks with aligned interests to climb together

If you would like to go on one of the club trips, or be informed of smaller trips organized by individual members, you should join the [climbers mailing list](http://mailman.mit.edu/mailman/listinfo/climbers).
