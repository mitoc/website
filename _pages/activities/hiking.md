### MITOC Hiking Trips

MITOC runs many hiking trips throughout the year. Events to look out for:

*   [Circus](/events/circus) - Held every 1-2 months April through October.
*   [Winter School](/events/winter-school) - Held annually in January. MITOC's biggest event. Includes winter skills lectures and weekend trips.
*   [Acadia](/events/acadia) - Held annually on Memorial Day weekend. Opportunities for hiking, climbing, and kayaking.
*   Smaller trips led by hiking leaders, usually announced by email the week before.

To get announcements of upcoming trips, join our [mailing lists](/mailing-lists). All trips are led by our [hiking leaders](/get-involved/become-3-season-leader) and open to any current MITOC [member](/join).

For more information or questions, free to contact the hiking chair at [3s-hiking-chair@mit.edu](mailto:3s-hiking-chair@mit.edu).
