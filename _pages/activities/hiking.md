### MITOC Hiking Trips

MITOC runs many hiking trips throughout the year. Events to look out for:

*   [Circus](/events/circus) - Held every 1-2 months April through October.
*   [Winter School](/events/winter-school) - Held annually in January. MITOC's biggest event. Includes winter skills lectures and weekend trips. Winter school also hosts the winter safety lectures which are mandatory for all winter hiking with MITOC.
*   [Acadia](/events/acadia) - Held annually on Memorial Day weekend. Opportunities for hiking, climbing, and kayaking.
*   Smaller trips led by hiking leaders, usually announced by email the week before.

To get announcements of upcoming trips, join our [mailing lists](/mailing-lists). All trips are led by our [hiking leaders](/get-involved/become-3-season-leader) and open to any current MITOC [member](/join).

For more information or questions, feel free to contact the hiking chair at [3s-hiking-chair@mit.edu](mailto:3s-hiking-chair@mit.edu).
