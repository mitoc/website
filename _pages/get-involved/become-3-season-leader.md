### Why does MITOC need 3-season hiking leaders?

MITOC runs all kinds of official hiking trips during the year outside of winter, at monthly circuses, Acadia, and many more. All these trips rely on safe, experienced hiking leaders. It is important to create a group of approved leaders who can lead 3-season hikes so all trips will go smoothly, safely, and enjoyably for all participants.

### What are the leader ratings?

*   Co-leader: can co-lead a hike with a leader.
*   Leader: can lead a hike with a co-leader or leader.

### How many leaders does each hike need?

Each hike requires one full leader and one co-leader. Hikes of 5 or fewer participants can have just one full leader.

### How many people can go on a trip?

There is a maximum trip size of 10 within the White Mountain National Forest. Outside the WMNF, MITOC hiking trips are limited to 15 people.

### What are the prerequisites to become a leader?

*   Co-leader: participate in two MITOC hiking events
*   Leader: upgrade from a co-leader by co-leading two hikes and having a leader submit a recommendation.

Ideally the 2 hikes should be on different weekends. However, please submit an application even if you don’t fulfill all of the requirements. Applications are evaluated on a case by case basis. If you have any questions or are unsure if your application has been reviewed please email [3s-hiking-chair@mit.edu](mailto:3s-hiking-chair@mit.edu)

Most new leaders will start as a co-leader. This provides an opportunity to learn under the guidance of a full leader. If you already have outside institutional leadership experience, you may be granted a full leader rating on a case-by-case basis.

### How do I become a leader?

*   [Submit an application](https://mitoc-trips.mit.edu/hiking/leaders/apply/)
*   Attend a new leader’s safety seminar, announced on the [main MITOC mailing list](http://mailman.mit.edu/mailman/listinfo/mitoc) and held roughly once a month during 3 season conditions.

You can do these in any order.

### I am a co-leader. How do I upgrade to leader?

*   Co-lead two hikes.
*   On one hike, let the full leader know you want to upgrade. Take point of the hike and handle the majority of the logistics and group management. This is to evaluate how you would do as a full leader with a potentially inexperienced co-leader.
*   [Submit an upgrade request](https://mitoc-trips.mit.edu/hiking/leaders/apply/).
*   The 3s hiking chair will contact the leaders you have co-led with to see how the hikes went. If all the above are successful, you will be granted an upgrade.

### What constitutes a 3-season hike?

We consider any hike "3-season" if winter conditions are not present, usually roughly April-October, though this varies vastly year to year. During shoulder seasons, the Winter Safety Committee decides whether conditions are 3-season or winter.

Guidelines for leading three season hikes are [here](/docs/MITOC_3SeasonHiking.pdf).

### What are the leader benefits?

*   Early signup for Circuses
*   Free gear rental from MITOC for official trips led
*   Course subsidy for your Wilderness First Aid certification (WFA, WAFA, WFR, WEMT)

### Can I lead a hike outside of circuses?

Yes! If you are an approved leader, you just need to notify the hiking chair that you want to run an official trip and announce it to [mitoc@mit.edu](mailto:mitoc@mit.edu).
