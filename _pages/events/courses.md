MITOC organizes various courses throughout the year. We recommend joining the mitoc-announce mailing list and the appropriate activity [mailing list](/mailing-lists) to stay informed. Some courses come with a subsidy if you have led a certain number of trips; see bottom of page for more.

### Wilderness First Aid

Wilderness Medicine differs significantly from standard first aid courses and other training that is oriented toward urban environments. This course teaches how to manage medical emergencies when hospitals and rescue services may not be available for an extensive time period. We prepare students for emergency situations that involve prolonged patient care, severe environments, and improvised equipment. Unlike some programs, this is not teaching urban first aid in the outdoors.

MITOC hosts an annual WFA course in the fall. Dates and signups will be announced on the mitoc-announce mailing list.

### Self Rescue

If your partner was hit by rockfall and hanging unconscious on the rope below, would you know how to escape the belay and rappel down to them to administer first aid? Could you do it quickly? Every climber should know how to deal with an emergency in the vertical realm, but the truth is that most don’t. Do you?

### Avalanche Awareness

Avalanches range in size and magnitude but can happen in many backcountry mountain situations. Whether skiing, hiking or climbing you should be aware of potential avalanche risks and how to identify potential avalanche situations. In the event that an avalanche does occur, proper training is the best hope for a rescue.

### Crevasse Rescue and Glacier Travel

Glaciers are a common medium necessary to climb some of the bigger peaks in the world. When crossing glaciers, however you will come across snow bridges and crevasses. Learning proper technique for crossing this terrain is covered in the course as well as rescuing someone from a crevasse.

### Subsidies

MITOC provides course subsidies to help offset the cost of learning outdoor safety skills.
**To be eligible for a subsidy, one must lead (or co-lead) two MITOC trips within +/- 1 year of the course**. The same trip cannot count for multiple subsidies. Subsidies are as follows.

#### WFA: 
+ **MIT student leaders (undergrad and grad)**: Course is subsidized to cost **$100** (difference is reimbursed)

+ **All other active leaders**: Course is subsidized to cost **$150** (difference is reimbursed)

#### WFR recert:

+ WFR recert organized by MITOC has the same student/non-student leader caps as WFA.
+ External WFR recert courses have the same cap if course fees are at most the cost of MITOC's course and are reimbursable up to the maximum reimbursement for that season (for WFA recert or WFA depending on what MITOC is offering that season) for the corresponding student/non-student cap otherwise.

#### All other safety courses (WFR, AIARE, Rock Rescue, Glacier Travel, etc):
+ All active MITOC leaders receive $100 off the full price of the course. Eligible for one subsidy per course.

Unless stated otherwise on a trip website, pay the course cost to the provider in full, and request reimbursement for the subsidy amount within a year of the course date. 

[Desk credit](/get-involved/become-desk-worker) can be used to pay (get reimbursed) for any safety course. Safety courses do not have to be mitoc organized. If there is ambiguity as to whether your safety course would qualify (not direclty listed on this webpage), contact the [leader coordinator](/about/officers). 

To request a subsidy, complete the instructions under *Course Subsidies or course desk credit payment* on [get reimbursed](/about/get-reimbursed). You can combine desk credit and leader subsidies for the same course. But you may only request one reimbursement per course, so wait until you fulfill the criteria for both.
