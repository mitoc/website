In _The High Road_, the powerful and bold Nina Williams tests herself on some of the highest, most difficult boulder problems ever climbed. In _United States of Joe’s_ climbers collide with a conservative coal mining community in rural Utah, to surprising results. And in _The Nose Speed Record,_ legends Tommy Caldwell and Alex Honnold battle Yosemite dirtbags Jim Reynolds and Brad Gobright in a high stakes race for greatness.

In January, 2015, American rock climbers Tommy Caldwell and Kevin Jorgeson captivated the world with their effort to climb The Dawn Wall, a seemingly impossible 3,000 foot rock face in Yosemite National Park, California.  
The pair lived on the sheer vertical cliff for weeks, igniting a frenzy of global media attention.  
But for Tommy Caldwell, The Dawn Wall was much more than just a climb. It was the culmination of a lifetime defined by overcoming obstacles. At the age of 22, the climbing prodigy was taken hostage by rebels in Kyrgyzstan. Shortly after, he lost his index finger in an accident, but resolved to come back stronger. When his marriage fell apart, he escaped the pain by fixating on the extraordinary goal of free climbing The Dawn Wall.  
Blurring the line between dedication and obsession, Caldwell and his partner Jorgeson spend six years meticulously plotting and practicing their route. On the final attempt, with the world watching, Caldwell is faced with a moment of truth. Should he abandon his partner to fulfill his ultimate dream, or risk his own success for the sake of their friendship?

No Man's Land Film Festival is an all-woman adventure film festival based out of the Rocky Mountains of Colorado that meets a need and desire to highlight and connect individuals who identify as women in pursuit of the radical. We are a collaboration and celebration of humans who are deeply engaged in enhancing the female presence in the adventure arena. The goal of this festival is to connect like-minded individuals who are action-oriented, wish to support a shared vision of gender equality, have a desire to experience their passions and environments through a uniquely female lens, and above all, love adventure. Along with cultivating a deep interest in exploring the vastness of our planet from a female point of view, No Man's Land strives to create a history of motivating audiences to implement and inspire change. Our mission transcends the films presented; this festival acts as a platform for progressive thought and movement in the outdoor industry.  At No Man's Land, we aim to **un-****define feminine** in adventure and sport through film.

_A special introduction to the film will be given by Mike McGinn - Friend of the producers, former Seattle Mayor, Cascade hiker, and avid reader of the Beckey guides._

Hailed as one of the most influential climbers of all time, Fred Beckey is the original American “Dirtbag"–one who abandons societal norms and material comforts in pursuit of a nomadic mountaineering lifestyle. This rebel athlete’s lifetime of accomplishments set the bar for the entire sport. He shattered records with an unparalleled string of superhuman first ascents, bushwhacking trails and pioneering direct routes thought previously impassable. Beckey burned bridges, eschewed fame and stayed unencumbered so his only obligation would remain conquering the next summit. He kept meticulous personal journals where he mused on everything from arcane geology to his romantic life, to the myriad sunrises he witnessed from vantages not seen by anyone else on Earth. An environmentalist before there was such a term, Beckey’s legacy includes 13 essential books that act as blueprints for new generations. He defiantly continued climbing until passing away in October 2017 at age 94.

### "[An American Ascent](http://www.anamericanascent.com/)"

on **Tuesday, February 28th @ 7:30 PM** in [MIT Building 26-100](http://whereis.mit.edu/?go=26)

**_This event is FREE and open to the Public!_**

AN AMERICAN ASCENT documents the first African-American expedition to tackle Denali (aka Mt. McKinley, North America's highest peak), while shedding light on the complex relationship many African-Americans have with the outdoors. As the United States transitions to a “minority majority” nation, a staggering number of people of color do not identify with America's wild places. By embarking on the grueling multi-week climb of 20,237ft Denali, nine African-American climbers try to bridge this “adventure gap” - challenging outdated notions of what adventure looks like by changing the face of America's biggest and baddest mountain on the 100th anniversary of its first summit.

Jeff Lowe’s Metanoia is the story of a legendary athlete’s rise to the top of his sport before a devastating fall from grace that precipitates perhaps the boldest solo mountain climb in history: Metanoia, on the North Face of the Eiger. Twenty years later, Jeff faces a terminal disease with the same courage and grace that characterized his career as a climber.

on

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src=

In the high-stakes game of big-wall climbing, the Shark’s Fin on Mount Meru may be the ultimate prize. Sitting at the headwaters of the sacred Ganges River in Northern India, the Shark’s Fin has seen more failed attempts by elite climbing teams over the past 30 years than any other ascent in the Himalayas.

In October 2008, Conrad Anker, Jimmy Chin and Renan Ozturk arrived in India to tackle Meru. What was meant to be a seven-day trip with the equivalent amount of food became a 20-day odyssey in sub-zero temperatures, thanks to the setback of a massive storm that showered the mountain with at least 10 feet of snow. Like everyone before them, their journey was not a successful one. But they had reached further than anyone else, beaten back just 100 meters below the elusive summit.

Pretty Faces is a film celebrating women who thrive in the snow. The concept for the film was originated by professional big mountain skier and SheJumps co-founder, [Lynsey Dyer](http://www.lynseydyer.com) with the objective of giving women and girls, young and old, a source of inspiration through a unique look at what is possible when boundaries are broken, dreams captured and friendships cultivated. In Lynsey’s words “I wanted to give young girls something positive to look up to…I wanted to give them their _Blizzard of Ahhs_, _Ski Movie_ or _High Life_, but done in a way that also shows the elegance, grace, community and style that is unique to women in the mountains.”

In its ninth year, the REEL ROCK Film Tour features a special presentation of the highly-anticipated feature-length film “Valley Uprising.”

The greatest untold story of American counterculture is that of the Yosemite Valley rock climbers. For the past fifty years, Yosemite’s massive cliffs have drawn explorers and madmen to leave materialism behind and venture onto the high, lonesome granite.

The larger-than-life characters of Yosemite carved out an “extreme bohemian” lifestyle in the Valley, living on red wine and boiled potatoes, clashing with National Park authorities, and pioneering the boldest climbs on Earth. T he torch has been passed down across three generations of climbers; through rivalries, tragedies and triumphs, the art of Yosemite climbing has advanced beyond anyone’s imagination.

Valley Uprising is the riveting, unforgettable tale of this bold tradition: half a century of struggle against the laws of gravity — and the laws of the land.
