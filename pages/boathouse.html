<h3>Details of the rental procedure</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Become a boathouse keyholder. To become a boathouse keyholder, MITOC members must complete boathouse training and then provide one hour of service to the boathouse once a year to maintain active keyholder status. Training sessions are held monthly, coordinated by the Boathouse Manager, and announced on the paddle listserv. If you became a keyholder last year, you can rent boats through May before renewing your keyholder training.</li>
    <li>Get certified to rent out the boat you want. Whitewater kayaks, sea kayaks and windsurfers are all restricted gear; only canoes can be rented out by all keyholders. The best way to get certified is to go on a trip with the appropriate boat chair so that they can make sure you have the skills needed to use the boat safely. Otherwise, you can talk with them at keyholder training or by emailing the boathouse-mgr listserv.</li>
    <li>For each trip that you want to use a sea kayak or take a canoe on a
    car, fill out a <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfphwLNGRzg6e_8CIA_WcPSr7tzmsM69MkmcFHqfUyMzrwP3A/viewform">float plan form</a>.
    </li>
    <li>Drop off deposit checks at MITOC office during <a href="https://mitoc.mit.edu/#calendar">MITOC office hours</a>, prior to your trip.
        <em>If you have current Frequent Flyer status, you may skip the rest of this step.</em>
        Otherwise, because boats are restricted and expensive, we require you
        to deposit checks ($300 and $700 in value) to cover any damage or theft
        of boathouse equipment you rent. These checks are kept for one year,
        and you can rent (any MITOC gear) as often as you like without writing
        more checks.
    </li>
    <li>As early as possible, email the <a href="mailto:boathouse-mgr@mit.edu">
        boat chairs</a> with your reservation request and respond promptly to
        any of their concerns. Please try to email us a week in advance, and
        the deadline is noon Wednesday for an upcoming weekend. Allow us a
        couple days to respond since we are busy and do this on a volunteer
        basis. As with other MITOC gear, each member can rent gear only for
        himself and one other person. Boathouse keyholders may borrow more than
        two boats so long as there is at least one MITOC member in the group
        for every two boats rented. Official MITOC trips also take precedence
        over individual rentals, so check that there are no conflicting trips
        scheduled on the MITOC calendar. If your reservation is approved, the
        boat chair will tell you and authorize the MITOC office to rent you a
        key.
    </li>
    <li>Make an <a href="https://mitoc.mit.edu/#pay">online pre-payment</a> for your equipment, sending confirmation of payment to the chair. When your reservation is approved (based on dates, gear availability, deposit having been made and rental payment confirmed), the boat chair will contact you and provide you with a PIN to access the lockbox that contains the key to the boathouse. Get your boat and gear from the boathouse. One key that will open the exterior doors to the loading dock, and the interior boat storage room doors. If you end up NOT taking out your boat because of “prohibitive weather conditions”, let the chairs know as soon as possible, and you will be able to use the payment made for any future MITOC rentals (NO refunds will be processed).</li>
    <li>Have a fun, safe trip! Respect the boats and don't let them get stolen. Do NOT take the key with you – <b>remember to always leave the key in the lockbox for other renters.</b></li>
    <li>Return and clean your boat and gear at the boathouse. If the boats were used in salt water or got dirty, please rinse them off before returning them. There is a sponge and bucket available in the sea-kayaking room. Also, please try to brush off any sand on the exterior of the boats. Life jackets and skirts also should be returned dry and have any salt or sand rinsed off. Return the key to the lockbox. <b>A late fee of $25/day will be charged if you forget to leave the key in the lockbox.</b></li>
    <li>Email the <a href="mailto:boathouse-mgr@mit.edu">boat chairs</a> and
    tell them how your trip went, about any boat problems or damage.
    </li>
